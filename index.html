  <h1>Homework #1</h1>
  <p>What I hope to gain from this course: Mainly frontend knowledge. 
    I am <em>most</em> interested in <strong><em>backend</em></strong> stuff like algorithms, 
    so I've been putting off learning about things like HTML. 
    I also hope to gain a better understanding about websites as well as other web services.</p>
